# sb.ltn.fi Time Saved Column Userscript

## Overview

This userscript adds a "Time Saved" column to the video table on the LTN site (sb.ltn.fi) and populates it with the product of the "Views" and "Duration" columns for each row. If the video category is 'poi_highlight', the duration is calculated using the end time instead of the length.

## Installation

1. **Install a Userscript Manager**: Install a userscript manager browser extension such as Tampermonkey (for Chrome) or Greasemonkey (for Firefox).
   
2. **Install the Userscript**: Click on the [userscript file](https://github.com/NoMoreAngel/userscripts/raw/main/sbltnfi/sbltnfi-time-saved-column.user.js), then your userscript manager should detect the script and prompt you to install it. Click on "Install" to add the script to your manager.

## Usage

After installing the userscript, visit [sb.ltn.fi](https://sb.ltn.fi/). The "Time Saved" column should automatically be added to the video table, displaying the calculated time saved for each video.
